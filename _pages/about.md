I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Prior to PolyU, I obtained my Doctor of Mechanical Engineering at Donghua University from 2016 to 2022, advised by Prof. Jingsong Bao.

My research interests include digital twin (DT) driven machining processes, bionic digital manufacturing, and smart manufacturing. Since 2019, I have been exploring the theory, technology, and applications of digital twins in the field of machining, building a strong foundation in both theory and practice.

During my academic career, I have participated in several key projects, including those funded by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's Intelligent Manufacturing Special Project, the Shanghai Science and Technology Commission, and the Doctoral Innovation Fund. I am also the principal investigator of a Youth Project funded by the Guangdong Provincial Joint Fund. I have published over 30 papers, including 10 first-author papers in SCI journals, 5 corresponding author papers, and 5 papers selected as ESI Highly Cited Papers. Additionally, I have filed more than 10 patents, with 9 granted.

I have served as a session organizer and chair for the 3rd International Conference on Digital Twins, as well as a member of the first executive committee of the Digital Twin Young Scholars Committee (China). I have been invited to give keynote speeches at prestigious conferences such as IMCC 2023 and DigiTwin 2022. I also serve as a reviewer for numerous international journals, including IEEE TII, IEEE SMC, JIM, TRJ, IJCIM, JED, SR, ES, and VR&IH.
